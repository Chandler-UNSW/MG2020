# MG2020
# Code adapted from https://github.com/djmv/MobilNet_SSD_opencv to achieve object decetion using the SSD MobileNet model.
# This model potentially offers advantages over YoloV3. It is also trained on the COCO dataset (although the code needs
# to be adjusted to detect sports balls).

# To run the file you can use:
#       python3 sample_img.py --[params]
# Note the changes in the file such as the default images and the aspect ratio
# Exit the produced image by pressing any key.
